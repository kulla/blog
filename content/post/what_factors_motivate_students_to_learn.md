_This is an summary of third chapter “What factors motivate students to learn?” in the book [How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching]( http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470484101.html ) by Ambrose et al. (2010)._

## Definition of motivation

Maehr and Meyer (1997) use the metaphor of motivation as a “personal investment”. It focus the taken actions and determines how individuals spend their resources (like time, energy and talent) in certain activities. Ambrose et al. conclude: “Students' motivation generates, directs, and sustains what they do to learn” (p. 69).

## Main factors influencing motivations

Goals are the main compass which directs our actions. Ambrose et al. mention the following main factors concerning goals which influence students' motivation:

* _Type of goal:_ The goal of learning might be one of several types which influences the evoked motivation. The goal types are (ordered by their effect on motivation starting with the category with the most positive effect):
    1. _Learning goals:_ Students truly want to learn and want to achieve competence.
    2. _Performance goals:_ Students try to do whatever is necessary in order to get a good grade, gain status, appear intelligent, etc. There are two subcategories:
        1. _Performance approach goals:_ Students meet normative standards to demonstrate competence.
        2. _Performance avoidant goals:_ Students meet normative standards to avoid incompetence.
    3. _Work avoidant goals:_ Students want to finish their work / meet course standards as quick as possible with the least possible effort.
* _Overlap between lecturer's and students' goals:_ The more those goals are aligned and not in conflict the higher is the motivation.
* _Number of accomplishable goals:_ The more goals the student can achieve during an action (like social or affective goals) the more is he or she motivated for doing it.
* _Value of goal:_ Subjective importance of the goal for the student. The higher (relative to conflicting goals) the student values the goal the more is he motivated achieving it. There are multiple sources of goal value:
    * _Attainment value:_ Satisfaction of accomplishing the goal.
    * _Intrinsic value:_ Satisfaction of working on achieving the goal.
    * _Instrumental value:_ Degree to which the goal helps for achieving other goals (like extrinsic rewards, getting high salary, etc)
* _Expectancies:_ The expectations the students have in successfully achieving the goal. These are influenced by the attribution of past actions and their (positive or negative) outcome. Types are:
    * _Outcome expectancies:_
        * _Positive outcome expetancies:_ Expectations of a positive outcome for an action.
        * _Negative outcome expectancies:_ Belief that an action has no influence on the desired outcome.
    * _Efficiency Expectancies:_ Belief of student that he is capable of taking the required actions for accomplishing a goal.
* _Enviornment:_ Supportive environments enhance the students' motivation and unsupportive environments decrease it.

_Notes:_ The goal type is context specific. For example a student might have work avoidant goals in one area but learning goals in another. Lecturers might falsely believe that their course goals are the same as the students experience.

## Lecturers possibilities to enhance motivation:

Ambrose et al. describe three levers for lecturers to increase students' motivation:

1. Increase students' goal value
2. Increase students' efficiency expectancies
3. Create a supportive environment

Motivation only occurs when all three dimensions are fulfilled. Thus, the lecturer need to concentrate on each dimension. The influence of these levers are shown in the following figure:
