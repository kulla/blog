_This is an summary of third chapter “What factors motivate students to learn?” in the book [How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching]( http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470484101.html ) by Ambrose et al. (2010)._

## Definition of motivation

Maehr and Meyer (1997) use the metaphor of motivation as a “personal investment”. It focus the taken actions and determines how individuals spend their resources (like time, energy and talent) in certain activities. Ambrose et al. conclude: “Students' motivation generates, directs, and sustains what they do to learn” (p. 69).

## Influencing factors of motivation

Ambrose et al. mention the following main factors concerning goals which influence students' motivation:

* _Goal type:_ The goal of learning falls into one of several types which influences the evoked motivation. These types are (ordered by their effect starting with the most positive):
    1. _Learning goals:_ Students truly want to learn / achieve competence.
    2. _Performance goals:_ Students try to do whatever is necessary in order to get a good grade, gain status, appear intelligent, etc. There are two subcategories:
        1. _Performance approach goals:_ Students meet normative standards to demonstrate competence.
        2. _Performance avoidant goals:_ Students meet normative standards to avoid incompetence.
    3. _Work avoidant goals:_ Students want to finish their work / meet course standards as quick as possible with the as least as possible effort.
* _Overlap between lecturer's and students' goals:_ The more the goals are aligned and not in conflict the higher is the motivation.
* _Number of accomplishable goals:_ The more goals the student can meet during an action (like social or affective goals) the more is he or she motivated for doing it.
* _Value of goal:_ The student's subjective importance of the goal. The higher (relative to conflicting goals) the student values the goal the more is he willing taking actions for accomplishing it. There are multiple sources of value:
    * _Attainment value:_ Satisfaction of accomplishing the goal.
    * _Intrinsic value:_ Satisfaction of working on achieving the goal.
    * _Instrumental value:_ Degree to which the goal helps achieving other goals (like extrinsic rewards, getting high salary, etc).
* _Expectancies:_ The expectations the students have in successfully achieving the goal. These are influenced by the attribution of past actions and their (positive or negative) outcome. Types are:
    * _Outcome expectancies:_
        * _Positive outcome expetancies:_ Expectations of a positive outcome for an action.
        * _Negative outcome expectancies:_ Belief that an action has no influence on the desired outcome.
    * _Efficacy Expectancies:_ Belief of student that he is capable of taking the required actions for accomplishing a goal.
* _Enviornment:_ Supportive environments enhance the students' motivation and unsupportive environments decrease it.

_Notes:_ The goal type is context specific. For example a student might have work avoidant goals in one area but learning goals in another. Besides lecturers might falsely believe that their course goals are the same as the students experience.

## Possibilities to enhance motivation:

Ambrose et al. describe three levers for lecturers to increase students' motivation:

1. Increase students' goal value
2. Increase students' efficiency expectancies
3. Create a supportive environment

Motivation only occurs when all three dimensions are fulfilled. Thus, the lecturer needs to concentrate on each dimension. The influence of these dimensions are shown in the following figure:

## Strategies for enhancing the motivation

Ambrose et al. describe the following strategies for increasing students' motivation:

* Strategies to establish value:
    * Connect the material to students interest
    * Provide authentic real world tasks
    * Show relevance of the course material for students' academic career (e.g. why do physics students need to learn mathematics?)
    * Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skill (which are learned during the course) to students future professional lives
    * Identify and reward what you value (
    * Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline
* Strategies that help students build positive expectancies:
    * Ensure alignment of objectives (course goals), assessments (testing of course goals) and instructional strategies (support for achieving course goals)
    * Identify and create an appropriate level of challenge
    * Provide early success opportunities
    * Articulate your expectations
    * Provide rubrics (set of criteria for students' work)
    * Provide constructive feedback
    * Be fair
    * Educate students how to attribute success and failure
    * Describe effective study strategies
* Strategies that address value and expectancies
    * Provide flexibility and control
    * Give students an opportunity to reflect
